My name is Dexter Volkman. Online I mostly go by dexmexter. Here is a little about me for those interested.

## Professional
I am currently employed at [Stratum Systems](https://stratum.it) as an IT support technician persuading computers, networks, and people to work together productively. Most days I feel like the printers are the worst behaved obstacle to cooperation.

CV link coming soon...
