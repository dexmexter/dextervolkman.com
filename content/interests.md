### Computers

I'm completely self-taught and have been learning about Linux and computers
since college. I would like to say that it is just a hobby but at this point it
might be more on an addiction, now that I've peeked behind the curtain of
computer technology, I'm not sure I could stop looking for more knowledge if I
tried ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

My curiosity is likely the biggest reason I was attracted to the Linux
operating system. The fact that I can dig down and read the source code for
everything my system is doing just blows me away. I will never know everything
about the computers I use but I am going to keep learning as much as I can.

#### Projects

Some of the projects I've worked on that I am most proud of:
- This website
- I completed Harvard's cs50 course through the edX platform. It was incredibly
  difficult and took way longer than I care to admit but I'm thrilled I was
  able to make it all the way through. More information on the course:
  <https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science>
    - My final project for the course is a Sudoku web application. It is not
      hosted anywhere (except on my home server) but heres a link to the source
      <https://github.com/dexmexter/cs50_final-project>
- I have a home server running [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) that I
  can't really show off to the internet but it is a fun ongoing project. My end
  goal is to have a redundant cluster of machines running a
  [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN, a
  [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) server, [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/),
  and my Sudoku game (see above). I'm sure I'll add more to that eventually but
  I still have a lot of work ahead of me just to get those things functional.
- Less exciting but I've also completed a handful of Codeacadamy courses. It
  was a great starting point for me but I think I would recommend people find
  somewhere else to start unless they are willing to pay for a full account.
    - Python 2
    - Bash
    - Git

#### Tools/Utilities

Here are some of the Unix programs I like to use on the regular:
- suckless utilities
    - dwm
    - st
    - slock
    - dmenu
- neovim
- tmux
- ranger
- newsboat
- keepassxc

### Music

I mostly play guitar and sing but am also passingly decent on the bass guitar,
hand percussion, piano, and trumpet. I love listening to electronic music and
would really like to get a [Synthstrom
Deluge](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/) to start creating some of my
own. I don't consider myself much of a creative, I am much more interested in
the patterns and analysis of music theory and music production.

      everything I've read so far
- Rock climbing
    - I have a membership at a local gym where I climb most V4 problems and a
      handful of V5 problems. Still trying to break through into V6 but no luck
      so far. I am sorely missing the gym during the current Covid-19 season
    - I've been climbing outdoors a handful of times and would love to get more
      experience doing that
