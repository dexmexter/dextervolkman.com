## Introduction

I've been trying to figure out a good way to compile a list of all the content
I've been reading/watching. I usually find something interesting every day but
outside of my browser history I don't have a good way to look back at the all
the interesting links I've found. I would like to have a nicely organized way
to keep track of this but until I come up with a design I like, I thought I
could at least start to keep track of the links. If anyone finds this list, it
is not going to be exhaustive but will give a good indication of the what I
have been looking into and learning about as time goes on it could become my
version of TIL (today I learned).
