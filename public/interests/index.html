                <h3 id="computers">Computers</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m completely self-taught and have been learning about Linux and computers since college. I would like to say that it is just a hobby but at this point it might be more on an addiction, now that I&rsquo;ve peeked behind the curtain of computer technology, I&rsquo;m not sure I could stop looking for more knowledge if I tried ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<p>My curiosity is likely the biggest reason I was attracted to the Linux operating system. The fact that I can dig down and read the source code for everything my system is doing just blows me away. I will never know everything about the computers I use but I am going to keep learning as much as I can.</p>
<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>
<p>Some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on that I am most proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>This website</li>
<li>I completed Harvard&rsquo;s cs50 course through the edX platform. It was incredibly difficult and took way longer than I care to admit but I&rsquo;m thrilled I was able to make it all the way through. More information on the course: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science</a>
<ul>
<li>My final project for the course is a Sudoku web application. It is not hosted anywhere (except on my home server) but heres a link to the source <a href="https://github.com/dexmexter/cs50_final-project">https://github.com/dexmexter/cs50_final-project</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a home server running <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> that I can&rsquo;t really show off to the internet but it is a fun ongoing project. My end goal is to have a redundant cluster of machines running a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> VPN, a <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> server, <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>, and my Sudoku game (see above). I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll add more to that eventually but I still have a lot of work ahead of me just to get those things functional.</li>
<li>Less exciting but I&rsquo;ve also completed a handful of Codeacadamy courses. It was a great starting point for my but I think I would recommend people find somewhere else to start unless they are willing to pay for a full account.
<ul>
<li>Python 2</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="toolsutilities">Tools/Utilities</h4>
<p>Here are some of the Unix programs I like to use on the regular:</p>
<ul>
<li>suckless utilities
<ul>
<li>dwm</li>
<li>st</li>
<li>slock</li>
<li>dmenu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>neovim</li>
<li>tmux</li>
<li>ranger</li>
<li>newsboat</li>
<li>keepassxc</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>I mostly play guitar and sing but am also passingly decent on the bass guitar, hand percussion, piano, and trumpet. I love listening to electronic music and would really like to get a <a href="https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/">Synthstrom Deluge</a> to start creating some of my own. I don&rsquo;t consider myself much of a creative, I am much more interested in the patterns and analysis of music theory and music production.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Rock climbing
<ul>
<li>I have a membership at a local gym where I climb most V4 problems and a handful of V5 problems. Still trying to break through into V6 but no luck so far. I am sorely missing the gym during the current Covid-19 season</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been climbing outdoors a handful of times and would love to get more experience doing that</li>
</ul>
