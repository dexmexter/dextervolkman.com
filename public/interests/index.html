<p>I have an RSS feed that gives me a steady supply of reading material. When I
find something I find really interesting or useful I add the link to a growing
list. This list can be found at <a href="https://dextervolkman.com/links">https://dextervolkman.com/links</a></p>
<h2 id="computers">Computers</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m entirely self-taught and have been learning about Linux and computers since
college. It began as just a hobby but now that I&rsquo;ve seen how much there is to
learn, I&rsquo;m not sure I could stop seeking knowledge if I tried ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<p>My curiosity is likely the biggest reason I was attracted to the Linux
operating system. The fact that I can dig down and read the source code for
everything my system is doing just blows me away. I will never know everything
about the computers I use but I am going to keep learning as much as I can.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>Some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on that I am most proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>This website</li>
<li>I compiled my own linux system from source by following the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable-systemd/">Linux From
Scratch</a> book. If
you would like to download the system you can do so <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JXqcG9EnXOpNSHf7I5TTrtikatTHqPnF/view?usp=sharing">right
here</a>.
I also have a post with instructions for how to take this <a href="/posts/tar-backup-and-restore">backup and
restore</a> it to a drive so that you can try it
out. Note that it is a very small system with limited functionality.</li>
<li>I completed Harvard&rsquo;s cs50 course through the edX platform. It was incredibly
difficult and took way longer than I care to admit but I&rsquo;m thrilled I was
able to make it all the way through. More information on the course:
<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science</a>
<ul>
<li>My final project for the course is a Sudoku web application. It is not
hosted anywhere (except on my home server) but heres a link to the source
<a href="https://github.com/dexmexter/cs50_final-project">https://github.com/dexmexter/cs50_final-project</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I have a home server running <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> that I
can&rsquo;t really show off to the internet but it is a fun ongoing project. My end
goal is to have a redundant cluster of machines running a
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> VPN, a
<a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> server, <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a>,
and my Sudoku game (see above). I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll add more to that eventually but
I still have a lot of work ahead of me just to get those things functional.</li>
<li>Less exciting but I&rsquo;ve also completed a handful of Codeacadamy courses. It
was a great starting point for me but I think I would recommend people find
somewhere else to start unless they are willing to pay for a full account.
<ul>
<li>Python 2</li>
<li>Bash</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toolsutilities">Tools/Utilities</h3>
<p>Here are some of the Unix programs I like to use on the regular:</p>
<ul>
<li>suckless utilities
<ul>
<li>dwm</li>
<li>st</li>
<li>slock</li>
<li>dmenu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vim</li>
<li>tmux</li>
<li>ranger</li>
<li>newsboat</li>
<li>keepassxc</li>
<li>ncmpcpp</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I mostly play guitar and sing but am also passingly decent on the bass guitar,
hand percussion, piano, and trumpet. I love listening to electronic music and
would really like to get a <a href="https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/">Synthstrom
Deluge</a> to start creating some of my
own. I don&rsquo;t consider myself much of a creative, I am much more interested in
the patterns and analysis of music theory and music production.</p>
