      <description>Intro I recently finished creating a home backup server so that I can start taking backups of my laptop automatically. It is a project that lays some groundwork for future systems I would like to implement. The server is working now and I want to take some time to document the pieces that I needed to get the basic operating system installed. This is meant to be a more generic server installation with a few items that were specific to the dv-storage server I was working on getting ready at the time.</description>
