      <description>Intro I recently finished creating a home backup server so that I can start taking backups of my laptop automatically. It is a project that lays some groundwork for future systems I would like to implement. The server is working now and I want to take some time to document the pieces that I needed to get the basic operating system installed. This is meant to be a more generic server installation with a few items that were specific to the dv-storage server I was working on getting ready at the time.</description>

      <description>Preamble In my quest to learn and become more proficient with computers, I will often have some kind of ongoing personal project that I will work on in my spare time. Over the past few weeks the project that has taken up my evenings has been building a Linux From Scratch system. The goal is to build a working linux system by downloading and compiling everything manually from the source code.</description>

      <description>This is something I have had to lookup on more than one occasion and would like my own reference so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look it up anymore.
First locate the name of the device using:
lsblk and/or
sudo fdisk -l In my case it is sdb. Make sure the device is not mounted.
umount /dev/sdb* Next we need to format the drive so that it is empty. This can be done by initializing a new file system on the disk.</description>
